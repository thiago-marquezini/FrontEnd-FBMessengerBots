# FrontEnd-FBMessengerBots

I started this project a few years ago and never finished it since the requester died (1 month after project started). Yeah, he (sladly) died before paying/finishing this project.
It was thought to manage and monitor Facebook Messenger Bots and Instagram Targeted Search.

Requirements:

CodeIgniter (w/ IonAuth)
PHP
